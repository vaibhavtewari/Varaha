Varaha is a light weights sampler which is efficient in small dimensions(10 or less). Samplers primary focus is parameter estimation of compact binaries from the gravitational wave signals.<br/><br/>
v1 is the flavour relevant to cheap likelihoods. This is described in https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.023001<br/>
v2 is signficantly more efficient than v1 but comes with an added cost of calculting sampling density. It it relevant for more expensive likelihoods(one hundreths of a second or more). This is described in ...
