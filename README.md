Varaha is a light weights sampler which is efficient in small dimensions(10 or less). Samplers primary focus is parameter estimation of compact binaries from the gravitational wave signals.
v1 is the flavour relevant for cheap likelihoods. This is described in https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.023001
v2 is signficantly more efficient than v1 but comes with an added cost of calculting sampling density. It it relevant for more expensive likelihoods(one hundreths of a second or more). This is described in ...
