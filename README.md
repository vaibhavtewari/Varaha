Varaha is a lightweight sampler that is efficient in small dimensions(10 or less). Sampler's primary focus is parameter estimation of compact binaries from the gravitational wave signals.<br/><br/>
i) v1 is the flavour relevant to cheap likelihoods. This is described [here](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.023001)<br/>
ii) v2 is significantly more efficient than v1 but comes with an added cost of calculating sampling density. It it relevant for more expensive likelihoods(one hundredths of a second or more). This is described [here
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16568).
